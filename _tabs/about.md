## About me

My name is Michiel, and I'm 22 years old and I study computer science at [KU Leuven](https://www.kuleuven.be/english/kuleuven/index.html). My main
areas of interest are computer graphics, the Vulkan API and the Rust programming language. On this website you'll find various
articles about my experiences in these fields.

## Current projects

### [Phobos](https://github.com/NotAPenguin0/phobos-rs)

A Rust library for Vulkan on desktop. Phobos provides abstractions to remove Vulkan boilerplate, manage resources and automate
synchronization.

### [Andromeda](https://github.com/NotAPenguin0/andromeda-rs)

A 3D terrain engine and landscape editor in Rust.
